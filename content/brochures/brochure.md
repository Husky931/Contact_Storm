# PIXAVENTURES | B2B DIGITAL GROWTH FOR EXPORT MANUFACTURERS

## WHO WE ARE

### Your Export Growth Partner for Chinese Manufacturers

Pixaventures is your specialized digital marketing agency, built exclusively to help Chinese manufacturers win overseas buyers in Europe, North America, the Middle East, and beyond.

**Bridging Factory Reality with Western Buyer Trust**
Our bilingual team—Chinese, European, and American strategists—understands both manufacturing operations AND Western purchasing psychology. We translate factory strengths (MOQs, certifications, lead times) into buyer-friendly messaging that converts on Amazon, Google, and social platforms.

**Creating Value Through Export-Focused Demand Generation**
We don't just run ads—we engineer demand from qualified overseas buyers actively searching for suppliers like yours. Our Amazon PPC, AI-optimized SEO, and Meta/TikTok campaigns deliver vetted leads ready to discuss orders—not just website visitors.

**Your Success Is Our Success**
With 30+ manufacturers served globally, we measure success by your export revenue growth—not vanity metrics. When your factory wins its first EU buyer through our Amazon campaign or lands a $50k order from a lead we generated, that's our win too.

## HOW WE WORK

### Simplifying Overseas Buyer Acquisition

• Strategy & Export Market Research  
• Amazon Listing Optimization  
• Western Buyer Persona Development  
• Conversion-First Creative (Ads, Websites, Videos)  
• AI Search Engine Optimization  
• In-House Campaign Execution  
• Weekly Lead Delivery & Reporting  
• Scalable Retainers (No Long-Term Lock-ins)

**Our Methodology: Factory-First, Buyer-Centric**
We start by auditing your factory's export readiness—certifications, MOQ flexibility, lead time transparency—then build digital assets that Western buyers trust. Consider us your external export sales team, generating qualified demand while your internal team closes deals.

**Agility Meets Cross-Cultural Insight**
Our strength is adaptability across cultures. We craft Amazon listings that avoid "factory-speak," design websites that answer Western buyer objections upfront, and run TikTok ads that resonate with procurement managers—not generic demographics.

**Innovative & Export-Specific Solutions**
From AI search optimization (57% of buyers now use ChatGPT/Gemini to find suppliers) to bilingual Shopify stores that auto-translate MOQ/certification details, we build solutions for the new export reality—beyond Alibaba dependence.

## THE NEW EXPORT LANDSCAPE

### 57% of Western Buyers Now Use AI Search to Find Suppliers

The digital buyer journey has fundamentally shifted. Western importers no longer start with Google alone—they query AI engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google Gemini with prompts like _"certified LED manufacturers in China with CE marking"_ or _"OEM yoga mat suppliers under $3 MOQ."_

**Why This Matters for Your Factory:**
• AI-driven traffic converts **23x higher** than traditional search—buyers arrive pre-qualified [[pixaventures.com]]
• Factories optimized for AI search capture high-intent buyers before competitors relying solely on Alibaba or Google SEO
• Western buyers trust AI recommendations as "neutral third-party validation"—critical for overcoming China supplier skepticism

**A robust export strategy now requires three layers:**

1. Traditional SEO (Google rankings for "your product + supplier")
2. Marketplace dominance (Amazon/Etsy visibility)
3. **AI search optimization** (structured data, FAQ schema, certification highlighting for AI crawlers)
